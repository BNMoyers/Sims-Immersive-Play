      What is Immersive Play?
    </h2>
    <p>
      When The Sims 2 debuted, it spawned a new playstyle among fans: a living, breathing world managed in minute detail outside of the game. Creators made spreadsheets and blogs to track their sims' worlds and often shared them on "By Sims, For Sims" style sites. For many, this was a golden age of collaborative storytelling as simmers created detailed worlds with more substance than even the most detailed city management games could offer.

      The open world gameplay of the Sims 3 didn't particularly lend itself to this style of play, and the number of sites dwindled. Despite the option to bring back rotational play in The Sims 4 the immersive playstyle never regained its former popularity.

      Sims Immersive Play is a multi-phase project which hopes to change all that! SIP aims to make immersive play more accessabile to a new generation of simmers by offering rules, tools, and databases for gameplay.
