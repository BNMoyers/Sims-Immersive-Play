# Sims-Immersive-Play
SIP is an ever-growing project meant to expand your Sims 4 gameplay. With rulesets, challenges, randomizers, and customizable databases, your Sims' neighborhoods will come to life like never before!

The planned development schedule for SIP includes 4 main phases. In Phase One, users will find rulesets and challenges from across the web, along with a comprehensive overview of the SIP playstyle and tips on implementing the system into their own game.

Phase Two expands the utility of the SIP site to include randomizers, generators, and other web tools that players can use to bring their worlds to life. 

This toolset is further fleshed out in Phase Three, where user accounts and customizable databases come online. The Phase Three toolset is what really sets SIP apart; it's all of the outside information a Legacy, By-Sims-For-Sims, Build-A-City, or other unconventional world state calls for, all managed and automated in an easy-to-use interface.

In Phase Four, creators would have the option to make their content public. With customized UIs and blogging tools just for SIP simmers will be able to share their worlds with other players and even build communities of "By Sims, For Sims" worlds.
